                <p>In May 2018 I moved to Canada to start a 2 year long Working Travel Visa,and was required to perform a variety of roles, ranging from working in the Bistro breakfast buffet, as a valet during the summer, and looking after small business lunches and corporate functions often by myself, between both of the Pan Pacific properties in Whistler. As a result I have spent a considerable amount of time interacting with by customers and Kitchen staff to discuss the need to share stock from each other’s pantries, changes to the function food orders or dealing with dietary requirements at the last minute.</p>

                <p>During my first at university, I began working solo on an educational game project. The basis for this project was a tutorial for a Pyhton based chess game I found online, using the pygame library. I started by following the tutorial, to which I then added a bank of questions relating to a certain subject. In order to make their move on the board each player must answer one of these randomly selected questions. The idea behind this project was make revising easier for students that have attention deficit disorders, using the game mechanic to help hold the students attention for an extended period of time.</p>
